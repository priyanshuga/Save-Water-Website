          Even though water eventually returns to Earth through the water cycle,
          it's not always returned to the same spot, or in the same quantity and
          quality. By reducing the amount of water we use, we can better protect
          against future drought years.

          Failing to conserve water can eventually lead to a lack of an adequate
          water supply, which can have drastic consequences. These include
          rising costs, reduced food supplies, health hazards, and political
          conflict.
